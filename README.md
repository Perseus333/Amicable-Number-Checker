# Amicable-Number-Checker
Finds if two nummbers are amicable numbers
Amicable numbers are two numbers that the sum of all the divisors of one number equals the other number, and viceversa.
This is a very primitive program but I pretend to upgrade it in the future(when I know more of HTML).
For now you have to edit the source code to see if two numbers are amicable.
If you have any concerns, or you find a bug, please contact me a t perseusmith73@gmail.com
